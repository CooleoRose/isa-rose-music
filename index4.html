    <h2>My Background Story:</h2>
    Violin. I started learning to play the violin in 2011, when I was in year 1. I chose the violin when my parents took me to the music shop, allowing me to choose to learn one of the many instruments I saw inside. I don’t remember this day at all, and I definitely don’t know why I chose the violin out of the vast collection of different instruments. At first, I took it up with a positive demeanour, according to my parents, although they did not enjoy the screeching that entailed while I learned the basics of making a proper sound with the instrument. A few years went by and I progressed, albeit my progression was a bit slow for my teachers liking. In the fourth, fifth and sixth years of learning the violin, I remember hating every bit of it, including the lessons, practicing and the ensemble groups I was a part of. My parents forced me to practice and I distinctly remember throwing tantrums for hours before I finally gave in and listened to them. During these years I wanted to quit the violin, put it behind me and never have to think about it or ‘torture’ myself again. It wasn’t until I came to CGS that I finally began to appreciate the instrument again. The music program was very inclusive and enjoyable, with opportunity for people of different abilities to work in the same groups, such as orchestra. After beginning to enjoy the violin again, I began to progress faster than ever, with a diploma reachable within a year or two from now. After appreciating and enjoying the violin for the past few years, I have come to realise how lucky I was to have been able to play the instrument of my choosing, for my parents to be able to afford tuition and for having parents to keep me going when it got tough. Violin has enabled me to extend my knowledge of music and I have even picked up two more instruments, because of the violin, in the past few years, the piano and viola. Music is now an integral part of my life that I cherish and would not be possible without starting to learn the violin almost ten years ago.
